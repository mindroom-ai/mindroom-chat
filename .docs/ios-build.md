# MindRoom iOS Build Instructions

## Prerequisites

- macOS with Xcode 15+ (ensure the iOS platform is installed via Xcode > Settings > Components)
- Apple Developer account (for signing/TestFlight)
- CocoaPods (`brew install cocoapods` or `sudo gem install cocoapods`)
- Node.js 18+

## First-time setup

```bash
# Clone the repo (or pull latest)
cd mindroom-cinny

# Install dependencies and build web assets
npm install
npm run build

# Sync web assets and install CocoaPods dependencies
npx cap sync ios
```

Recommended preflight checks before opening Xcode:

```bash
npm run test
npm run build
npm run ios:icons
npm run appstore:preflight
```

## Open in Xcode

```bash
npx cap open ios
```

Or open `ios/App/App.xcworkspace` directly in Xcode.

## Configure signing

1. Open the project in Xcode
2. Select the "App" target
3. Go to "Signing & Capabilities"
4. Select your Apple Developer team
5. Set bundle ID to your app ID (for example `chat.mindroom.app`)

## Build & Run (Debug)

- Select your iPhone (or simulator) as target
- Cmd+R to build and run

## iOS Push Notifications Setup (APNs + Matrix)

This project includes native iOS push registration via Capacitor and Matrix pusher provisioning.

1. Configure `config.json`:

```json
{
  "push": {
    "ios": {
      "enabled": true,
      "appId": "chat.mindroom.app",
      "gatewayUrl": "https://YOUR-PUSH-GATEWAY/_matrix/push/v1/notify",
      "appDisplayName": "MindRoom iOS",
      "deviceDisplayName": "MindRoom iOS",
      "append": true,
      "format": "full"
    }
  }
}
```

2. Run `npx cap sync ios`.
3. In Xcode, open `App` target → `Signing & Capabilities` and verify `Push Notifications` is present.
4. Run on a physical iPhone (APNs does not fully validate in simulator).
5. In-app, go to `Settings -> Notifications -> iOS Push Notifications` and enable it.

Server-side requirement: your Matrix push gateway (for example Sygnal-compatible) must be configured
to map this app/bundle/APNs environment and forward notifications to APNs.

Full payloads provide sender and message previews for unencrypted rooms. Encrypted-room pushes stay
generic because the homeserver and push gateway cannot decrypt their message content.

## Archive for TestFlight / App Store

Automated alternative: fastlane lanes cover the TestFlight upload, App Store
metadata, and screenshot upload steps — see `.docs/ios-fastlane.md`.

1. In Xcode, set scheme to `App` and destination to `Any iOS Device (arm64)`.
2. Product → Archive.
3. In Organizer, select the archive and click `Distribute App`.
4. Choose `App Store Connect` → `Upload`.
5. In App Store Connect, attach the build to your app version and complete TestFlight/App Review metadata (see `APP_STORE_SUBMISSION_PACKET.md`).

## Updating web content

After making changes to the web app:

```bash
npm run build
npx cap sync ios
```

Then rebuild in Xcode.

## App Icon

Canonical native iOS square source is `public/res/branding/mindroom-logo-square.png`.
Regenerated iOS icons use `ios/App/App/Assets.xcassets/AppIcon.appiconset/AppIcon-512@2x.png` as the copied 1024x1024 opaque source.
Regenerate all iOS icon slots with:

```bash
npm run ios:icons
```

## Notes

- `npx cap sync ios` must be run before each archive so `ios/App/App/public`, `config.xml`, and `capacitor.config.json` are regenerated.
- Xcode shows native iOS asset-catalog images (AppIcon/Splash), not the in-app transparent logo directly. If branding changes in `public/res/branding/mindroom-logo-square.png`, re-render native icon/splash assets and rebuild.
- Web/PWA favicon assets are generated from the transparent branding source `public/res/branding/mindroom-logo.png`, while the browser/runtime favicon uses the optimized `public/res/branding/mindroom-favicon.png`.
- `NSAppTransportSecurity` allows cleartext only for local-network homeservers; non-local homeservers must use HTTPS.
- For this build profile, registration is enabled and Apple SSO provider support is required in homeserver auth flows.
- The app includes usage descriptions for microphone/camera/photo-library access to support voice and media attachment flows.
- For App Store submission readiness, complete the checklist in `APP_STORE_COMPLIANCE.md`.

## Troubleshooting (Xcode / CocoaPods)

- If Xcode build logs show a sandbox denial for `Pods-App-frameworks.sh` (for example `deny file-read-data .../Pods-App-frameworks.sh`), disable **User Script Sandboxing** for the `App` target build settings (`ENABLE_USER_SCRIPT_SANDBOXING = NO`) and rebuild.
- After changing AppIcon/Splash images, Xcode and iOS may cache previews/icons. Use **Product → Clean Build Folder** and reinstall the app on device/simulator if the old icon still appears.
