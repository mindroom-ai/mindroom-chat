MindRoom Chat is the client for [MindRoom](https://github.com/mindroom-ai/mindroom), the open-source platform for AI agents that know you and your work.
MindRoom agents are real Matrix users, so MindRoom Chat is a full Matrix client, built on [Cinny](https://cinny.in).
It shows what chat apps made only for people cannot: replies that stream with every tool call visible, approval cards, interactive canvases, and the agent's own browser.

These are stills from the [showcase](https://docs.mindroom.chat/showcase/) recordings: MindRoom Chat and a real MindRoom backend, with a fictional company and scripted model responses.

- **Live replies**: agent replies stream in place, with collapsible tool traces, the model and run details, and a button to stop them.
- **Approvals and questions**: approval cards and multiple-choice questions sit in the conversation, one tap away.
- **Canvases**: an agent can open a page it wrote, such as a dashboard, a slide deck, or a form, beside the conversation ([Interactive Canvases](https://docs.mindroom.chat/canvases/)).
  Canvases are on at chat.mindroom.chat and in iOS builds, and self-hosted deployments turn them on in [Configuration](#configuration).
- **Computer**: watch an agent's browser live, take control for a login or passkey, and hand it back; choose the computer service under Settings → General → Computers, or set a default with `mindroom.computers.apiUrl`.
- **Threads first**: a thread-aware composer, deep links, search, unread state, and timeline recovery keep long agent conversations easy to follow, and very long replies arrive whole.
- **Voice**: record voice messages, and call an agent through MatrixRTC with embedded Element Call.
- **Commands**: `!` commands autocomplete as you type.
- **17 languages**, including Arabic and both Chinese scripts; choose yours under Settings → General → Language, and see the [localization guide](./docs/localization.md) to help translate.

## Built on Cinny

MindRoom Chat began as a Cinny fork, but it is now developed as an independent product for Matrix-based AI-agent workflows.
It keeps Cinny's Matrix foundation while owning its product direction, release cadence, native apps, deployment model, and MindRoom integrations.

<details>
<summary><b>What MindRoom Chat changes</b></summary>

| Area | MindRoom Chat direction |
| --- | --- |
| Product | Independent MindRoom branding, roadmap, defaults, onboarding, CI, and releases |
| Agent workflows | Streaming edit resolution, response cancellation, model/run metadata, collapsible tool traces, long-text sidecars, and `!` command autocomplete |
| Threads and navigation | Thread-aware composition, deep links, search, unread state, and timeline recovery tuned for long-running agent conversations |
| Calls and voice | Agent-call flows built on MatrixRTC and embedded Element Call, including encrypted call-key handling and native microphone preflight |
| Native iOS | Capacitor packaging, Apple-oriented authentication, APNs/Sygnal push support, voice recording behavior, and App Store release tooling |
| Deployment | Runtime configuration and base-path support for root or subpath hosting, plus fork-owned Docker and release workflows |
| Engineering | A large regression suite and a maintained compatibility ledger for product, Matrix SDK, deployment, and native-app changes |

</details>

Cinny remains the upstream foundation and is credited in [Upstream attribution](#upstream-attribution).
Compatible upstream improvements continue to be evaluated for incorporation, while MindRoom Chat's product behavior and release decisions are owned here.
For the implementation history and rationale behind individual changes, see [`FORK_CHANGES.md`](./FORK_CHANGES.md).

## Self-hosting

Run the published image:

```bash
docker run -p 8080:80 ghcr.io/mindroom-ai/mindroom-chat:latest
```

Or build the image yourself:

```bash
docker build -t mindroom-chat:latest .
docker run -p 8080:80 mindroom-chat:latest
```

To run MindRoom, a Matrix homeserver, and MindRoom Chat together, use [mindroom-stack](https://github.com/mindroom-ai/mindroom-stack).

### Static hosting

Build and serve `dist/` with your preferred web server.

### Runtime base path (single build artifact)

- Build once with relative assets: `npm run build`
- At runtime set `APP_BASE_PATH` to `/` or `/mindroom`
- Example: `APP_BASE_PATH=/mindroom ./your-server`

Containerized runtime also supports:

- `APP_ENABLE_SERVICE_WORKER` (enabled by default in container runtime config)

When the client shares an origin with sibling applications, add their root-relative path prefixes to the runtime config so the PWA app-shell fallback leaves those navigations to the network:

```js
window.__SERVICE_WORKER_NAVIGATION_FALLBACK_EXCLUDE_PATHS__ = ['/other-app'];
```

Only root-relative paths without a query or fragment are accepted.
Each prefix excludes its exact path and descendants without excluding similarly named client routes.

### Build-time base path

- `APP_BUILD_BASE_PATH=/mindroom npm run build`

### Reverse-proxy examples

- Netlify: [`netlify.toml`](./netlify.toml)
- Nginx: [`contrib/nginx/mindroom-chat.domain.tld.conf`](./contrib/nginx/mindroom-chat.domain.tld.conf)
- Caddy: [`contrib/caddy/caddyfile`](./contrib/caddy/caddyfile)

## Configuration

MindRoom Chat reads `config.json` from the root it is served from.
Builds and the development server generate it from [`config.mindroom.json`](./config.mindroom.json), and iOS builds also apply [`config.mindroom.ios.json`](./config.mindroom.ios.json); the repository's `config.json` is Cinny's upstream sample, used only as a fallback by the end-to-end tests.
With the Docker image, mount your own file at `/app/config.json`.
A mounted file replaces the bundled configuration entirely, so start from a copy of the image's own file (in a checkout, `config.mindroom.json` is the same starting point):

```bash
docker run --rm --entrypoint cat ghcr.io/mindroom-ai/mindroom-chat:latest /app/config.json > my-config.json
docker run -p 8080:80 -v "$PWD/my-config.json:/app/config.json:ro" ghcr.io/mindroom-ai/mindroom-chat:latest
```

Notable options:

- homeserver defaults and allowed-server policy,
- auth behavior (including `allowRegistration`, support/privacy/terms links),
- splash loading copy via `splash.loadingMessages`,
- MindRoom placeholder copy via `mindroom.thinkingPlaceholderMessages`,
- canvases and their npm library loading via `mindroom.canvas.enabled` and `mindroom.canvas.libraries`,
- the default computer service via `mindroom.computers.apiUrl`,
- agent UI automatic-opening policy via `mindroom.uiActions.autoOpenFromHomeservers`,
- additional application-link schemes via `messageRendering.additionalAllowedUriSchemes`,
- sidebar entry points including `sidebar.showThreads` and `sidebar.showExploreCommunityInSimpleMode`,
- welcome-page behavior.

<details>
<summary><b>Opening agent panels automatically</b></summary>

Agent requests can open a canvas, Computer, Settings, or Members automatically only when the agent's Matrix server name is explicitly trusted by the deployment:

```json
{
  "mindroom": {
    "uiActions": {
      "autoOpenFromHomeservers": ["mindroom.chat"]
    }
  }
}
```

MindRoom's shipped configuration lists `mindroom.chat`.
An absent or empty list disables automatic opening; valid requests still have a button the addressed user can click.
Entries match the exact server name in the Matrix user ID, including any port; URLs, wildcards, and implicit subdomains are unsupported.
The existing checks for joined `mindroom_` agents on the viewer's own homeserver still apply.
Only list homeservers whose operators control the agent username namespace; this setting trusts that operator policy, not every account on the server.
Live delivery, focus, conversation, and computer authorization checks continue to apply.

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Explorer in Simple Mode</b></summary>

Explorer is hidden from the sidebar by default in Simple Mode.
To show it in Simple Mode, set `sidebar.showExploreCommunityInSimpleMode` to `true` in the served `config.json`:

```json
{
  "sidebar": {
    "showExploreCommunityInSimpleMode": true
  }
}
```

Setting it to `false` or omitting it keeps Explorer hidden in Simple Mode.
This option does not affect the full interface, which `sidebar.showExploreCommunity` controls; its code default is `true`, but MindRoom's shipped configuration sets it to `false`, so set it to `true` as well to show Explorer there.

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Additional link schemes</b></summary>

Formatted message links can allow additional desktop application URI schemes:

```json
{
  "messageRendering": {
    "additionalAllowedUriSchemes": ["obsidian"]
  }
}
```

Use scheme names without `://`.
Trailing `:` or `://` delimiters are normalized if supplied.
The configured list is additive to the built-in safe schemes.
Browser-sensitive schemes including `javascript`, `data`, `file`, `blob`, `vbscript`, `about`, `chrome`, `chrome-extension`, `filesystem`, `resource`, and `view-source` are always ignored.

</details>

## Development

```bash
npm ci
npm run test
npm run build
```

Start a local development server with `npm start`.

<details>
<summary><b>Dockerized Matrix end-to-end tests</b></summary>

The Docker boundary for local e2e is the Matrix stack, not the MindRoom Chat app itself.
MindRoom Chat and Playwright stay on the host.
Docker only runs a disposable Tuwunel homeserver.

Start or stop the local Matrix stack:

```bash
npm run e2e:matrix:up
npm run e2e:matrix:down
```

Run the e2e suite against that Docker-backed homeserver:

```bash
npm run test:e2e:docker-matrix
```

Pass extra Playwright arguments after `--`:

```bash
npm run test:e2e:docker-matrix -- e2e/live/smoke.spec.ts
npm run test:e2e:docker-matrix -- --grep "three stored accounts"
```

Notes:

- The stack is defined in [`e2e/docker-compose.matrix.yaml`](./e2e/docker-compose.matrix.yaml).
- The wrapper provisions three local e2e accounts, seeds the shared fixture room, and starts a static built preview on `http://127.0.0.1:28090` for the deployed clear-cache spec.
- The main app under test still runs from the host via Playwright's normal `webServer` (`npm run start -- --host 127.0.0.1 --port 4173 --strictPort`) unless `E2E_NO_WEB_SERVER=1`.
- Useful overrides:
  `E2E_MATRIX_PORT`,
  `E2E_MATRIX_SERVER_NAME`,
  `E2E_MATRIX_AUTO_DOWN=1`,
  `E2E_ENABLE_DEPLOYED_FIXTURE=0`,
  `E2E_SERVER_COMMAND`,
  `MINDROOM_TUWUNEL_IMAGE`.

## Native apps

### iOS build and archive

```bash
npm run build:ios
npm run ios:icons
npm run appstore:preflight
npx cap sync ios
npx cap open ios
```

Then archive from Xcode (`App` scheme, `Any iOS Device (arm64)`).

iOS docs:

- Checklist: [`APP_STORE_COMPLIANCE.md`](./.docs/APP_STORE_COMPLIANCE.md)
- Submission metadata/review notes packet: [`APP_STORE_SUBMISSION_PACKET.md`](./.docs/APP_STORE_SUBMISSION_PACKET.md)
- Build guide: [`ios-build.md`](./.docs/ios-build.md)
- Canvases and computers in iOS builds: [`ios-panels.md`](./docs/ios-panels.md)

### iOS pairing links

The iOS app opens hosted `/connect?code=…` links on its approval page using the accounts already signed in to the app.
See [iOS pairing links](docs/ios-pairing-links.md) for association-file hosting, Apple Developer capability/profile setup, self-hosted forks, and device verification.

<details>
<summary><b>TestFlight via Xcode Cloud</b></summary>

The Xcode Cloud workflow should archive the iOS app with the `Archive - iOS` action.
Set that action's `Distribution Preparation` to `TestFlight (Internal Testing Only)` so successful archives are prepared for TestFlight.
If that setting changes after a successful archive, rerun the workflow because existing archives are not prepared for TestFlight retroactively.
[`scripts/ios-ci-version.mjs`](./scripts/ios-ci-version.mjs) chooses the App Store version and build number.
The build number is `IOS_BUILD_NUMBER` when set, otherwise Xcode Cloud's `CI_BUILD_NUMBER`, otherwise the `<n>` of a `v<version>-mindroom.<n>` release tag, otherwise the checked-in Xcode build number.
With `CI_BUILD_NUMBER`, the marketing version adds that counter to the patch of the newer of the `package.json` version and the checked-in `MARKETING_VERSION`, so version `4.12.6` with build `64` uploads as `4.12.70 (64)`.
Set `IOS_MARKETING_VERSION` or `IOS_BUILD_NUMBER` in Xcode Cloud only when overriding those defaults is intentional.

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>iOS push notifications (APNs + Matrix)</b></summary>

Native iOS push plumbing is included in this fork (`@capacitor/push-notifications` + Matrix pusher registration).
The bundled `config.mindroom.json` already turns `push.ios` on for MindRoom's own app (`chat.mindroom.app`) and push gateway.
For your own app build:

1. Set `appId` and `gatewayUrl` in `push.ios` in `config.mindroom.json`, which iOS builds bundle; `appId` is the ID your push gateway knows the app by, conventionally its bundle ID:

```json
{
  "push": {
    "ios": {
      "enabled": true,
      "appId": "YOUR.BUNDLE.ID",
      "gatewayUrl": "https://YOUR-PUSH-GATEWAY/_matrix/push/v1/notify",
      "appDisplayName": "MindRoom Chat iOS",
      "deviceDisplayName": "MindRoom Chat iOS",
      "append": true,
      "format": "full"
    }
  }
}
```

2. Rebuild and sync the iOS project after config or dependency changes: `npm run build:ios && npx cap sync ios`.
3. In Xcode, confirm `Signing & Capabilities` includes `Push Notifications`.
4. Run the app on a physical iPhone and enable `Settings → Notifications → iOS Push Notifications` inside MindRoom Chat.
5. Ensure your Matrix push gateway has an app entry named after the same `appId` that accepts APNs tokens for your app.

`format: "full"` is an explicit opt-in that lets a Sygnal-compatible gateway receive the sender and message preview for unencrypted rooms.
Omitting it uses the privacy-preserving `event_id_only` fallback.
Encrypted rooms use a generic notification because the homeserver cannot read their message content.

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Android Play internal releases</b></summary>

- The `dev` push release workflow (see [Releases](#releases)) also builds a signed Android App Bundle and publishes it to the Google Play `internal` track when it creates a new MindRoom GitHub release.
- Required GitHub secrets:
  `ANDROID_UPLOAD_KEYSTORE_BASE64`,
  `ANDROID_UPLOAD_KEYSTORE_PASSWORD`,
  `ANDROID_UPLOAD_KEY_ALIAS`,
  `ANDROID_UPLOAD_KEY_PASSWORD`,
  and `GOOGLE_PLAY_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_JSON`.
- The keystore secret should be the base64-encoded upload keystore file.
  The Play service account must have permission to release `com.mindroom_ai.app`.

</details>

## Releases

- Every push to `dev` creates an automated GitHub release tag in the format `v<base_version>-mindroom.<n>`.
- `base_version` is read from [`package.json`](./package.json) by default (or `BASE_VERSION` if set), with upstream-style semver tags as fallback; `<n>` increments from existing fork tags for that base version.
- The Python helper is reusable across forks via env vars: `RELEASE_TAG_PREFIX`, `RELEASE_TAG_SUFFIX`, `BASE_TAG_PREFIX`, `BASE_VERSION`.
- Local preview of the next tag:

```bash
npm run release:next-tag
```
