/**
 * 2026-07-06 eager-cache policy: `relationSnapshotComplete` is NOT
 * required for open-time completeness. It is only provable by a full
 * `/relations` drain, so requiring it forced every thread warmed by the
 * room deep-history sweep (Step A — count-proven complete, tail loaded)
 * to re-download its entire history at open just to prove relations.
 * A reply-count-proven `snapshotComplete` + `tailLoaded` + a known
 * backward start is complete for PAINT; divergence (missed edits,
 * redactions, reactions the sweep could not attribute) is the
 * choke-point reconcile's job — D7: coverage decides paint, never
 * revalidation. The flag itself is still tracked/persisted: the prewarm
 * band uses it to decide which threads get a background proving fetch.
