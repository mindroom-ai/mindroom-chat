  // of the same identity to the sink (reconciler onRepaired payloads,
  // SDK sync/echo deliveries), and dedup across overlapping key sets
  // is exactly the merge's contract. The AC2 live flow reads 3 per
  // run — and still reads 3 with the onRepaired hydrated-view payload

  // one displaced loser carried `.replacingEvent() != null` while the
  // chosen winner had `.replacingEvent() == null` — i.e. the picker
  // rule (raw replacement presence must win a same-id tie) was
  // violated at the eventMap merge seam.
  //
  // History: the RG5c cycle originally installed this counter inside
  // `replaceFallbackInstanceRegistry` as a pre-overwrite check on the
  // fallback registry map. The F1 sweep (d5f04e90) removed that
  // registry to close a memory-hazard shape (module-scope Map holding
  // strong MatrixEvent refs, unbounded in prod), which also removed
  // the counter. Per team-lead: the counter itself is a pure scalar
  // and must survive as the permanent alarm on the picker rule.
  // Re-homed at the canonicalization site in
  // `threadRenderUtils.ts::setEventForKeys`, where the same

  // collection — a scalar bump on a shape that
  // `pickPreferredThreadRenderEvent`'s RG5-fix2 rule already
  // guarantees cannot fire.
  //
  // Interpretation: must stay 0. Any non-zero reading is a real
