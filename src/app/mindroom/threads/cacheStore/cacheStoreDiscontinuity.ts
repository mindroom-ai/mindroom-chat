/**
 * CINNY-207 P3.2: tail-discontinuity markers on the room-timeline
 * meta row.
 *
 * When the SDK reports a limited sync (RoomEvent.TimelineReset on the
 * room's unfiltered timelineSet), events between our last sync token
 * and the server's current state may have been dropped. We can't fetch
 * them from RoomEvent.Timeline because the SDK never fired for them.
 * The engine's gap tracker records the fact into the cache so the
 * Phase 4 backfill scheduler can execute a fill for the room later —
 * this module owns the read/write of that marker.
 *
 * The marker lives on the room-timeline meta row (roomId, scope=='')
 * as an optional additive field (`tailDiscontinuity`), so the schema
 * version does not change and older readers ignore it.
