/**
 * Task #125 follow-up (2026-07-04): iOS WebKit kills flick momentum the
 * moment anything writes `scrollTop` programmatically. The thread
 * back-pagination pipeline prepends events and then restores the scroll
 * anchor with exactly such writes — and because the scroll-driven
 * trigger deliberately fires DURING the flick (prefetch headroom), the
 * prepend commit used to land mid-momentum and stop the scroll dead on
 * finger release. Downward scrolling never prepends, which is why it
 * kept its inertia.
 *
 * The original fix split pagination fetch from its render commit: data
 * is fetched while the flick is in flight, but the commit waits for the
 * scroller to be quiescent. Current thread/room prepends are compensated
 * through the offset ledger without a commit-time scroll write; this
 * waiter also gates the later exactly-cancelling ledger settlement, which
 * DOES write `scrollTop` and therefore must only run at true rest.
 * Quiescence means no scroll events for `idleMs`, no sampled `scrollTop`
 * movement during that window, and no active touch. Sampling matters on
 * iOS because compositor momentum can keep changing the offset while
 * JavaScript scroll-event delivery pauses. A clamped scroller (momentum
 * slammed into the top edge) stops moving, so the edge case resolves
 * through the same idle path.
 *
 * `maxWaitMs` caps finite pagination waits so a pathological continuous
 * scroller still gets content instead of being starved. Ledger-settlement
 * consumers pass Infinity because their coherent margin can remain live
 * until genuine rest without delaying the fetched content itself.

// scroll event marks the session live and only its scrollend releases the
