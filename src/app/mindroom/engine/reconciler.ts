/**
 * CINNY-207 P5.1: engine reconciler.
 *
 * Every thread open schedules one reconcile pass through the
 * P4.1 `BackfillScheduler`. Coverage decides what to PAINT (D7); the
 * reconciler decides what to REPAIR. When cache and server agree the
 * pass is a cheap no-op (fetch, diff, empty). When they diverge (a
 * missed edit, redaction, or relation) the pass applies the repair in place using
 * the P1.2 machinery (`hydrateCachedEvents` → `applyCachedRedactions`,
 * `applyCachedReplaceRelations`, `reconcileRelationEventsWithAggregation`)
 * and fires a single `onRepaired` tick so the render layer picks up
 * the change without per-repair flicker.
 *
 * Scheduler wiring:
 *   - Kind: `'reconcile'` (own dedup domain). Because AC8's dedup key
 *     includes `kind`, a reconcile job and a `'thread-backfill'` job
 *     on the same thread coexist by design — they do different things
 *     (backfill fetches older history; reconcile checks the tail for
 *     server-truth divergence).
 *   - Priority: band 0 (the user is looking at this room / thread
 *     right now; a reconcile that trails a `noteRoomFocused` is the
 *     freshest signal we have).
 *   - Coalescing: falls out of the scheduler for free — a second
 *     `scheduleReconcile` while the first is in-flight returns the
 *     same promise identity, `schedulerDeduped` bumps.
 *
 * Tuwunel stale-copy handling (P3 gate work):
 *   Empirically the docker Tuwunel homeserver serves un-pruned redacted
 *   events on `/relations` and `/messages` for ~10 seconds after a
 *   redaction. `createPreferLiveEventMapper` (see `eventRepository.ts`)
 *   is the single source of truth for re-applying that redaction onto
 *   the SDK live instance (cascades through the SDK's
 *   `Relations.BeforeRedaction` listener and removes stale reaction
 *   chips). The reconciler MUST funnel every fetched raw event through
 *   that mapper — bypassing it would let a stale server copy un-repair
 *   a fresh redaction the client already knew about.
 *
 * F7 removal: the pre-P5 tail refresh (`refreshLatestThreadRelationsTail`)
 * capped at a single limit-200 batch, so a divergence more than 200
 * events deep never converged after open. The reconciler pages further:
 * it keeps requesting until the returned chunk overlaps the cached
 * window by event id, or the SDK signals "no more", or the abort signal
 * fires. Bounded above by `MAX_RECONCILE_ITERATIONS` for the same
 * reason `fetchAllThreadRelations` has a cap — a pathological
 * homeserver can otherwise stream tokens indefinitely.

 *     object references via `fallbackThreadEventsState.events` (see

 *     — if the SDK has a newer live instance for the same event id
 *     (e.g. a live sync just landed the m.replace target update while
 *     the cache still held an older copy), we prefer the live one so
 *     the repair sees the freshest state. This mirrors P1.2's
 *     both-ways-heal contract and keeps the cache path aligned with
 *     the SDK-live path.
 *   - Absent `hydratedEvents` (defensive fallback), we re-hydrate the
 *     raw JSON via `preferLive` — the prior P5.1 behavior. On
 *     complete-coverage this branch is unreachable in production
 *     because `hydrateThreadFromCache` always sets `hydratedEvents`.
 *
 * Root event handling: `hydratedRootEvent` follows the same rule; when
 * absent we fall back to remapping `cachedPage.rootEvent`. Kept
 * ordered "root first, then events" to match the array shape
 * `mapCachedThreadPageEvents` produced pre-fix.
